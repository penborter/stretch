# Stretch Theme

Hello World! 

## Table of Contents

The Table of Contents to the right is optional–just set `toc: true` if you want to include it.

## Usage

There are two key elements of the theme to highlight: the foreground and background colours, and the choice in how to display each collection.

### Two-colour system

Two colour variables can be used to set all the colours for the theme:

- `$fg` (foreground)
- `$bg` (background) 

Variations of these two colours are then derived and used throughout the site. It is recommended that you choose a pair of colours with a high contrast; at the very least you'll want to be able to read the `$fg`-coloured text on a `$bg`-coloured background.

### List.html

You can choose how to display your collections using the [`list.html`]() layout. This layout has three versions, depending on the front matter you include in your page. See the template's [books](/books), [posts](/posts), and [projects](/projects) pages for examples of the three layouts.

1. A plain list of collection items - set `layout: list` with no other changes required. *E.g.: [Books](/books)*
2. A list of collection items separated by year - `layout: list` and `by_date: true` in the front matter. *E.g.: [Posts](/posts)*
3. A list of collection items as cards - set `layout: list` and `card: true` in the front matter. *E.g.: [Projects](/projects)*

## Images

The theme includes a `picture.html` file in the `_includes` folder for any photos you want to add. The usage is described in the [includes file](https://github.com/penborter/stretch/blob/main/_includes/picture.html). 

{% include picture.html
   file="stretching.png"
%}

## Other Formatting

### Header 3
More than three levels of headings is too many––go back up to level 3.
