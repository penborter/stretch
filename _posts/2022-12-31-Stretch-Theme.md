# Stretch Theme

Hello World! 

## Table of Contents

The Table of Contents to the right is optional–just set `toc: true` if you want to include it.

## Usage

There are two key elements of the theme to highlight: the foreground and background colours, and the choice in how to display each collection.

### Two-colour system

Two colour variables can be used to set all the colours for the theme:

- `$dark`
- `$light`

Variations of these two colours are then derived and used throughout the site. It is recommended that you choose a pair of colours with a high contrast; at the very least you'll want to be able to read the `$dark`-coloured text on a `$light`-coloured background. 

[Here](https://randoma11y.com/) is a suggested resource for generating two-colour pairs.

### Theme Switch / Dark-Light mode

The theme includes a JS-based theme switch button based on the two theme colours `$dark` and `$light`. 

Basically, the colours are swapped throughout when the button is clicked, with some minor exceptions that can be found in [layout.scss](https://github.com/penborter/stretch-theme/blob/main/_sass/layout.scss), under the `[data-theme="dark"]` styles. The two colour system will still work if the theme switch button isn't included. 

### List.html

You can choose how to display your collections using the [`list.html`](https://github.com/penborter/stretch-theme/blob/main/_layouts/list.html) layout. This layout has three versions, depending on the front matter you include in your page. See the template's [books](/books), [posts](/posts), and [projects](/projects) pages for examples of the three layouts.

1. A plain list of collection items - set `layout: list` with no other changes required. *E.g.: [Books](/books)*
2. A list of collection items separated by year - `layout: list` and `by_date: true` in the front matter. *E.g.: [Posts](/posts)*
3. A list of collection items as cards - set `layout: list` and `card: true` in the front matter. *E.g.: [Projects](/projects)*

## Images

The theme includes a `picture.html` file in the `_includes` folder for any photos you want to add. The usage is described in the [includes file on Github](https://github.com/penborter/stretch/blob/main/_includes/picture.html). Images added this way can come in two sizes: normal (default), and wide which overflows the sidebar by default. Wide images' overflow amount is set by the `$pic-wide` variable in [`layout.scss`](https://github.com/penborter/stretch-theme/blob/main/_sass/layout.scss).

{% include picture.html
   file="stretching.png"
   class="wide"
%}

## Other Formatting

Other formatting examples are below, starting with a blockquote from the *Kama Sutra*.

> If variety is sought in all the arts and amusements, such as archery and others, how much more should it be sought after in the art of love.

You can also use the [`quote.html`](https://github.com/penborter/stretch-theme/blob/main/_includes/quote.html) includes file, which also takes the author, title and even link to all be included and formatted within the blockquote.

{% include quote.html
content="We need more variety on the web. We need more people creating their own spaces on the web. Spaces that they own, spaces that they control. Spaces where they can share their creativity, personality, voice, experience, knowledge, skills. So if you feel that the web is getting boring, commodified and homogeneous, if you feel that the web is controlled by a handful of large corporations, this is one way that you can make a bit of a difference."
